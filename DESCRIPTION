Title: Data Generation for Graph Reconstruction Using Monte Carlo Sampling
Description: Create various graph types and generate synthetic data using a simple Monte Carlo sampling approach. Sampling can be based on defined input graphs, either directed, undirected, with and without weights or on given data. Additionally, functions for graph reconstruction, assessment of graph reconstructs and graph visualization are provided. At the moment, we mainly concentrate on small to medium sized graphs up until around approximately 1000 nodes for which the runtimes of the functions should be in a reasonable range.
